# Roll a Ball (2016) â€” My First Unity Game

Short project notes for the Roll a Ball project I made in 2016 following the Unity Learn tutorial: https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball

## About
A small learning project made while following the official Unity "Roll-a-Ball" tutorial. The game is a simple ball-rolling collect-the-pickups demo.

## How to open
- Open the project folder in Unity (use a Unity Editor version compatible with 2016 projects).
- Alternatively, open the solution in Visual Studio: `Roll a Ball.sln`.

## How to play
- Move the ball with WASD or Arrow keys - or tilt your phone.
- Collect pickups without hitting the walls/falling off.
